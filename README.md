# NLP-Genre-Classification

In this package, I create an LSTM model in PyTorch to predict a movie's genre based on its IMDB description. I then recreate the model visualization techniques from Garcia *et. al* 2021 (https://vciba.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s42492-021-00090-0). See the Jupyter notebook in IMDB_genres_description_words.ipynb for a detailed walkthrough of my process.

In future versions, I plan to gather the visualizations into a single interactive dashboard.
