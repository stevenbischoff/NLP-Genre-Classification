# NLP-Genre-Classification

In this package, I create an LSTM model in PyTorch to predict a movie's genre based on its IMDB description. I then recreate the model visualization techniques from Garcia *et. al* 2021 (https://vciba.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s42492-021-00090-0). An interactive dashboard can be found at https://nlp-genre-classification-68136a2a1ad7.herokuapp.com/ . The user can interact with the app by clicking on rows in the Movies table to show information about the model's reasoning for that example.

The Jupyter notebook in IMDB_genres_description_words.ipynb contains a detailed walkthrough of my process, as well as an explanation of each visualization in the dashboard.
